/*
How this works:
jobs.dm contains the job defines that work on that level only. Things like equipping a character, creating IDs, and so forth, are handled there.
Role Authority handles the creation and assignment of roles. Roles can be things like regular marines, PMC response teams, aliens, and so forth.
Role Authority creates two master lists on New(), one for every role defined in the game, by path, and one only for roles that should appear
at round start, by name. The title of a role is important and is a unique identifier. Two roles can share the same title, but it's really
the same role, just with different equipment, spawn conditions, or something along those lines. The title is there to tell the job ban system
which roles to ban, and it does so through the roles_by_name master list.

When a round starts, the roles are assigned based on the round, from another list. This is done to make sure that both the master list of roles
by name can be kept for things like job bans, while the round may add or remove roles as needed.If you need to equip a mob for a job, always
use roles_by_path as it is an accurate account of every specific role path (with specific equipment).

It is possible that after looping through everyone, no one is assigned a command position
despite having it selected. This is going to be rare, but it can still happen.
After much thought, I believe this is intended behavior, because even if a player
wants to play a command position, but their character doesn't fit the guidelines, more suited
candidates should have a better shot at it first. Should that fail, they can still late join.
More or less the point of this system, and it will safeguard new players from getting command
roles willy nilly.
