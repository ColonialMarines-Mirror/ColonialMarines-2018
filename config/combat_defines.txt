##DAMAGE CALCULATION DEFINES
##If you are wondering what point these values have,
##they should also transfer over to various forms of combat.
##Assuming those forms of combat will exist in the future, but
##for right now they exist for shooting guns at things.

##Global settings for projectile damage and accuracy multiplication. Can increase or decrease it based on these numbers.
##This can be changed in the game, and is based off 1 instead of .01. It's just multiplied by .01 after the number is changed.
##So, 0.95 is less than 1.05. The latter will result in more damage/accuracy, the former in less.
PROJ_BASE_ACCURACY_MULT 0.01
PROJ_BASE_DAMAGE_MULT 0.01

##Global settings for projectile variance for damage and accuracy. This is the base other variance is added to.
PROJ_VARIANCE_HIGH 105
PROJ_VARIANCE_LOW 95

##This is the lower boundry of a critical.
CRITICAL_CHANCE_LOW 5 
##This is the upper boundry of a critical.
CRITICAL_CHANCE_HIGH 10
##This is the initial multiple * after soaking damage.
BASE_ARMOR_RESIST_LOW 1.0 
##This is the derived multiple * after soaking damgage again.
BASE_ARMOR_RESIST_HIGH 2.0
##Xenos use this as a lower boundary for soaking damage or adding more armor.
XENO_ARMOR_RESIST_LOW 0.5
##Xenos use this as the upper boundary for deflecting damage on their second pass.
XENO_ARMOR_RESIST_HIGH 1.5
